    "\n",
    "You'll notice the best words according to this script are *NOT* the same as the best words in top_words. Why is this?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Duplicate letters**: The first reason, is that duplicate letters just don't do well in wordle, a lot of words with two e's or two a's score really high, because those are common letters on their own, but having two of them is redundant and takes up a slot that could be another letter.\n",
    "- **Over-reliance on vowels**: For some reason, words with 3 or 4 vowels actually perform quite poorly. I am not entirely sure of the reason. Wordle pros say they lead to more \"traps\" but I have no idea what that means. Regardless, high vowel count words score high, but don't perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "**This is important** because while there is clear corelation between scoring high and performing well, there are tons of outliers. It is entirely possible that the best performing word is the 215th highest scoring one, in which case we wouldn't get that answer. However, I estimate running the simulation on all 12,000 valid Wordle words would take approximately 50 hours. The 100 top scoring words almost certainly include the best Wordle word. But if you disagree, please try running the full experiment and getting back to me.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do want to try a version where I only run say 10 simulations on all 12,000 words, then take the best performing words from there, run 100 simulations, and so on. That might have a better chance of pulling up some weird words, but I don't have the time yet..\n"
